Now we will use your R skills to explore a dataframe.

## R tips

Don't worry if you can't remember everything - data scientists and computer programmers don't memorize everything either.  That's why there's a help function built in to R!

As a reminder, here are a few useful commands for exploring dataframes:
```
dim()
head()
tail()
summary()
str()
```

If you need help remembering how to use a command, use `?`
```
?dim
```

If you start using R frequently, you'll naturally start to remember some of the common commands.  But don't hesitate to look things up, or ask if you get stuck!
