GDSCN is a group of educators gathered with the aim to bring genomic data science education to students at diverse institutions. Skills Level Genetics Novice: no genetics knowledge needed Programming skills Novice: no programming experience needed Learning Objectives Does adding text here fix the weird headings? "],["teaching-recommendations.html", "Chapter 1 Teaching Recommendations Audience and Context 1.1 Lesson Plan 1.2 Computing Requirements", " Chapter 1 Teaching Recommendations The primary goal of this exercise is to get students comfortable interacting with the R console. Students will complete several swirl lessons introducing basic R concepts, and then apply their new skills by conducting a brief exploration of a dataframe. The swirl lessons touch on several additional R commands and concepts beyond those mentioned in the learning objectives and provide a useful starting point for going deeper if you desire. Additional swirl lessons can be found at the swirl Course Network. This exercise is designed to be used either As a stand-alone “taste of R”, to introduce students to the field of data science, give them an idea of what a data scientist’s day-to-day work looks like, and help students see it as something they could do. As an entry point for a more in-depth course or workshop. In this case we recommend following up on important topics using additional resources (such as R for Data Science). The swirl lessons are great for letting students work through the basics in a “real” R environment where they get immediate feedback, but they are hard for students to refer back to later. We find swirl most useful for giving students a first look at the big ideas, along with practice typing commands into the console. This sets them up well for a more in-depth treatment over the subsequent course/workshop sessions. Audience and Context From SARS book Audience Undergraduate biology majors Graduate students with less exposure to bioinformatics Prerequisites Layman understanding of genetics (understanding of DNA, genes, trait inheritance) Some previous exposure to the central dogma of molecular biology Class Type Lab (computer-based) Homework for a Lecture Class Size 1-50 Lesson Duration 20-30 minute pre-lab lecture 3 hour lab for undergraduate students 1 hour lab for graduate students Additional short lecture modules Assessment Type Short answer questions at each lab stage Lesson Length One class period From CourseSource 1.1 Lesson Plan 1.2 Computing Requirements RStudio R packages swirl dplyr This book provides instructions on how to set these up in the cloud using the AnVIL platform, so that your students will not need to install anything. Depending on your needs, you might decide to run this activity on a different cloud provider, such Posit Cloud (formerly RStudio Cloud), or have your students install RStudio themselves.

In the R console window, type the following commands to load the swirl package: library(swirl) swirl() Install the course “R Programming: The basics of programming in R”, by following the instructions provided by swirl. Enter your name. Press ENTER. Enter 1, 2, or 3. Install the course “R Programming: The basics of programming in R”. Complete your first lesson. Select “R Programming”. Select “Basic Building Blocks”, by entering 1 ( i.e. the corresponding lesson number ). Follow the instructions provided by swirl to complete your first lesson. At the end, when swirl asks if you would like to receive Coursera credit, select “No”. 4.2 Complete additional swirl lessons Estimated time: 80 min Complete additional swirl lessons. Select “R Programming” Compete each of the following lessons: 4: Vectors 5: Missing_Values 6: Subsetting_Vectors 12: Looking_at_Data Once you have completed all the lessons listed above, exit swirl. To exit swirl, type bye() in the R console, press ESC on your keyboard, or enter 0 in response to the swirl course menu prompt.

Data scientists and computer programmers don’t memorize everything either. That’s why there’s a help function built in to R! As a reminder, here are a few useful commands for exploring dataframes: dim() head() tail() summary() str() If you need help remembering how to use a command, use ? ?dim If you start using R frequently, you’ll naturally start to remember some of the common commands. But don’t hesitate to look things up, or ask if you get stuck! 5.2 Explore the ??? dataframe Here are some instructions for exploring awesomedata! "],["wrap-up.html", "Chapter 6 Wrap-up 6.1 Pause RStudio environment 6.2 Delete RStudio environment", " Chapter 6 Wrap-up Cloud computing costs are based on the amount of time you use the computing resources, so it’s important to clean up after yourself when you’re done, and not just leave the computers running. There are two ways to “shut down” RStudio on AnVIL: Pause the environment: This will save a copy of your work, and then release the computers for other people to use them. Do this if you plan to continue working in RStudio. It’s similar to turning off your computer or phone - when you start it back up, everything will be where you left it. This still costs a small amount of money, but much less than leaving the computer running. Delete the environment: This will delete everything and then release the computers for other people to use them. Do this if you are completely finished working in RStudio, or if your future work will be in a new environment. It’s similar to throwing your computer or phone in the trash! You will not be able to recover your work. Make sure you have saved anything you need before you delete your environment. 6.1 Pause RStudio environment The upper right corner reminds you that you are accruing cloud computing costs. You should minimize charges when you are not performing an analysis. You can do this by clicking on “Stop cloud environment”. This will release the CPU and memory resources for other people to use. Note that your work will be saved in the environment and continue to accrue a very small cost. This work will be lost if the cloud environment gets deleted. If there is anything you would like to save permanently, it’s a good idea to copy it from your compute environment to another location, such as the Workspace bucket, GitHub, or your local machine, depending on your needs. 6.2 Delete RStudio environment Stopping your cloud environment only pauses your work. When you are ready to delete the cloud environment, click on the gear icon in the upper right corner to “Update cloud environment”. Click on “Delete Environment Options”. If you are certain that you do not need the data and configuration on your disk, you should select “Delete everything, including persistent disk”. If there is anything you would like to save, open the compute environment and copy the file(s) from your compute environment to another location, such as the Workspace bucket, GitHub, or your local machine, depending on your needs. Select “DELETE”.
