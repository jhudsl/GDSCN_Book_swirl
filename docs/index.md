# About {-}

In this exercise, students are introduced to the basics of R using the `swirl` package (https://swirlstats.com), which teaches students R from within the R console.  The primary goal of this exercise is to get students comfortable interacting with the R console.

<!--
Class Type should be one of the following (from CourseSource):
- Lecture
- Lab
- Seminar
- Discussion Section
- On-line
- Other
-->

<!--
Lesson Length should be one of the following (from CourseSource):
- Portion of one class period

## Learning Objectives {-}

- Open RStudio and locate important panels (R console, Help)
- Run commands in the R console
- Explain what vectors and dataframes are in R
- Use common R commands to work with R objects (e.g. assign, print, subset, math operations)
- Explore a dataset using base R commands (e.g. `dim`, `summary`, `str`)
