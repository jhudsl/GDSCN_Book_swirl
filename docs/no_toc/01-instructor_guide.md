# Teaching Recommendations

The primary goal of this exercise is to get students comfortable interacting with the R console.  Students will complete several `swirl` lessons introducing basic R concepts, and then apply their new skills by conducting a brief exploration of a dataframe.

This exercise is designed to be used either

1. As a stand-alone "taste of R", to introduce students to the field of data science, give them an idea of what a data scientist's day-to-day work looks like, and help students see it as something they could do.
1. As an entry point for a more in-depth course or workshop.  In this case we recommend following up on important topics using additional resources (such as [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)).  The `swirl` lessons are great for letting students work through the basics in a "real" R environment where they get immediate feedback, but they are hard for students to refer back to later.  We find `swirl` most useful for giving students a first look at the big ideas, along with practice typing commands into the console.  This sets them up well for a more in-depth treatment over the subsequent course/workshop sessions.

The `swirl` lessons touch on several additional R commands and concepts beyond those mentioned in the learning objectives and provide a useful starting point for going deeper if you desire.  Additional `swirl` lessons can be found at the [swirl Course Network](http://swirlstats.com/scn/).

## Lesson Plan

## Computing Requirements

- RStudio
- R packages
  - `swirl`
  - `dplyr`

This book provides instructions on how to set these up in the cloud using the [AnVIL platform](https://anvil.terra.bio/), so that your students will not need to install anything.  Depending on your needs, you might decide to run this activity on a different cloud provider, such [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) (formerly RStudio Cloud), or have your students install RStudio themselves.
