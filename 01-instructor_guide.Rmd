## Teaching Recommendations {-}

This exercise is designed to be used either

1. As a stand-alone "taste of R", to introduce students to the field of data science, give them an idea of what a data scientist's day-to-day work looks like, and help students see it as something they could do.

2. As an entry point for a more in-depth course or workshop.  In this case we recommend following up on important topics using additional resources (such as [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)).  The `swirl` lessons are great for letting students work through the basics in a "real" R environment where they get immediate feedback, but they are hard for students to refer back to later.  We find `swirl` most useful for giving students a first look at the big ideas, along with practice typing commands into the console.  This sets them up well for a more in-depth treatment over the subsequent course/workshop sessions.
