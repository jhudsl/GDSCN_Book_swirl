# About this Course {-}

In this exercise, students are introduced to the basics of R using the `swirl` package (https://swirlstats.com), which teaches students R from within the R console.

The primary goal of this exercise is to get students comfortable interacting with the R console.  Students will complete several `swirl` lessons introducing basic R concepts, and then apply their new skills by conducting a brief exploration of a dataframe.

The `swirl` lessons touch on several additional R commands and concepts beyond those mentioned in the learning objectives and provide a useful starting point for going deeper if you desire.  Additional `swirl` lessons can be found at the [swirl Course Network](http://swirlstats.com/scn/).

## Learning Objectives {-}

- Open RStudio and locate important panels (R console, Help)
- Run commands in the R console
- Explain what vectors and dataframes are in R
- Use common commands to manipulate R objects (e.g. assigning, printing, subsetting, mathematical operations)
- Carry out a basic exploration of rectangular data using base R commands (e.g. `dim`, `summary`, `str`)

## Core Concepts and Competencies {-}

This activity addresses the following core concepts and competencies, as described by the associated societies and working groups:
