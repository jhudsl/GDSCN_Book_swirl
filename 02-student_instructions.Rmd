# Setup

Welcome!  This lab will introduce you to some basic data analysis using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/).  In order to do this, there are a few steps you need to complete so that you can access the material.

## Set Up Your Computer

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
cow::borrow_chapter(
  doc_path = "child/_child_student_create_account.Rmd",
  branch = "KCox-student-signup",
  repo_name = "jhudsl/AnVIL_Template"
)
```

## Access Materials

Next you will need to access the required materials and software.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
workspace_name <- "Workspace_name"
workspace_link <- "Workspace_link"
billing_project <- "provided by your Instructor"
```

:::{.warning}
This **will not work** until your instructor has given you permission to spend money to "rent" the computers that will power your analyses, (by adding you to a "Billing Project").
:::

On AnVIL, you access files and computers through **Workspaces**.  Each Workspace functions almost like a mini code laboratory - it is a place where data can be examined, stored, and analyzed. The first thing we want to do is to copy or “clone” a Workspace to create a space for you to experiment.  This will give you access to

- the files you will need (data, code)
- the computing environment you will use

:::{.notice}
**Tip**
At this point, it might make things easier to open up a new window in your browser and split your screen. That way, you can follow along with this guide on one side and execute the steps on the other.
:::

To clone an AnVIL Workspace:

1. Open Terra - use a web browser to go to [`anvil.terra.bio`](https://anvil.terra.bio/)

1. In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to "Workspaces". Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click "Workspaces".

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Screenshot of Terra drop-down menu.  The "hamburger" button to extend the drop-down menu is highlighted, and the menu item "Workspaces" is highlighted.'}
ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a5Da6qX9BG7Q_6XAz7MvlDyWTvssm2hWwuo1WFJXb_0/edit#slide=id.g117989bd49c_0_150")
    ```

1. You are automatically directed to the "MY WORKSPACES" tab.  Here you can see any Workspaces that have been shared with you, along with your permission level.  Depending on how your instructor has set things up, you may or may not see any Workspaces in this tab.

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Screenshot of Terra Workspaces page with the "MY WORKSPACES" tab selected.  The "MY WORKSPACES" tab and the column showing permission level are highlighted.'}
ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a5Da6qX9BG7Q_6XAz7MvlDyWTvssm2hWwuo1WFJXb_0/edit#slide=id.g17144dbacd0_0_303")
    ```
    
1. Locate the \"`r workspace_name`\" Workspace.
    a. If it has been shared with you ahead of time, it will appear in "MY WORKSPACES".  

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Screenshot of Terra Workspaces page with the "MY WORKSPACES" tab selected. The "MY WORKSPACES" tab a Workspace name are highlighted.'}
ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a5Da6qX9BG7Q_6XAz7MvlDyWTvssm2hWwuo1WFJXb_0/edit#slide=id.g17144dbacd0_0_320")
    ```
    b. Otherwise, select the "PUBLIC" tab.  In the top search bar, type the name of the workspace \"`r workspace_name`\".

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Screenshot of Terra Workspaces page with the "PUBLIC" tab selected. The "PUBLIC" tab and search box are highlighted.  The the user has typed in the term "sars". A Workspace related to SARS appears in the results.'}
ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a5Da6qX9BG7Q_6XAz7MvlDyWTvssm2hWwuo1WFJXb_0/edit#slide=id.g17144dbacd0_0_327")
    ```
    c. You can also go directly to the Workspace by clicking this link: `r workspace_link`.
    
1. Clone the workspace by clicking the teardrop button (![teardrop button](resources/images/teardrop.png){#id .class width=25 height=20px}). Select "Clone".  Or, if you have opened the Workspace, you can find the teardrop button on the top right of the Workspace.

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Screenshot showing the teardrop button. The button has been clicked revealing the "clone" option. The Clone option and the teardrop button are highlighted.'}
ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/182AOzMaiyrreinnsRX2VhH7YsVgvAp4xtIB_7Mzmk6I/edit#slide=id.ged15532ded_0_625")
    ```
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Screenshot of the Dashboard for the Workspace that we want to clone. The teardrop button has been clicked to bring up the options. The "Clone" option from the list is highlighted.'}
ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JvfOluHe543cUCyyH3zz0ew-1J1QjhdYGZufW9NrC_M/edit#slide=id.g117abafa453_0_577")
    ```

1. You will see a popup box appear, asking you to configure your Workspace
    a. Give your Workspace clone a name by adding an underscore ("_") and your name. For example, \"`r paste0(workspace_name, '_First_Last')`\".
    a. Select the Billing project `r billing_project`.
    a. Leave the bottom two boxes as-is.
    a. Click “CLONE WORKSPACE”.
    
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Screenshot showing the "clone a workspace" popout. The Workspace name, Billing Project, and Clone Workspace button have been filled in and highlighted.'}
ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/182AOzMaiyrreinnsRX2VhH7YsVgvAp4xtIB_7Mzmk6I/edit#slide=id.ged15532ded_0_648")
    ```

1. The new Workspace should now show up under "My Workspaces".  You now have your own copy of the Workspace to work in.
    
-----
    
1. Click the teardrop button on the far right next to the Workspace you want to clone.

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Screenshot of Terra "My Workspaces" menu with the Workspace that we want to clone. The teardrop button has been clicked to bring up the options. The "Clone" option from the list is highlighted.'}
ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JvfOluHe543cUCyyH3zz0ew-1J1QjhdYGZufW9NrC_M/edit#slide=id.g117abafa453_0_432")
    ```

-----

1. Click on the name of a Workspace to open it.  Opening and viewing a Workspace does not cost anything.

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Screenshot of Terra Workspaces page with the "My Workspaces" tab selected.  The name of one of the Workspaces is highlighted.'}
ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ioYY0n3CcrP934WRKEsQ1aKocPqfswdWWHxYCf76BCg/edit#slide=id.g10f3888d99c_0_163")
    ```

1. When you open a Workspace, you are directed to the Workspace Dashboard.  This generally has a description of the Workspace contents, as well as some useful details about the Workspace itself.

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Screenshot of a Terra Workspace.  The "Dashboard" is highlighted.'}
ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ioYY0n3CcrP934WRKEsQ1aKocPqfswdWWHxYCf76BCg/edit#slide=id.g10f3888d99c_0_170")
    ```

# Project: Explore dataframe

Now we will use your new R skills to explore a data.frame!

<br>

## R tips

Don't worry if you can't remember everything!  Data scientists and computer programmers don't memorize everything either.  That's why there's a help function built in to R!

As a reminder, here are a few useful commands for exploring dataframes:
```
dim()
head()
tail()
summary()
str()
```

If you need help remembering how to use a command, use `?`
```
?dim
```

If you start using R frequently, you'll naturally start to remember some of the common commands.  But don't hesitate to look things up, or ask if you get stuck!

## Explore the ??? dataframe

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
cow::borrow_chapter(
  doc_path = "child/dataset/awesomedata/_child_explore_awesomedata.Rmd",
  repo_name = "jhudsl/GDSCN_Book_swirl"
)
```

# Wrap-up

Cloud computing costs are based on the amount of time you use the computing resources, so it's important to clean up after yourself when you're done, and not just leave the computers running.

There are two ways to "shut down" RStudio on AnVIL:

- **Pause** the environment: This will save a copy of your work, and then release the computers for other people to use them.  **Do this if you plan to continue working in RStudio**.
    - It's similar to turning off your computer or phone - when you start it back up, everything will be where you left it.
    - This still costs a small amount of money, but much less than leaving the computer running.  
- **Delete** the environment: This will delete everything and then release the computers for other people to use them.  **Do this if you are completely finished working in RStudio**, or if your future work will be in a new environment.
    - It's similar to throwing your computer or phone in the trash!
    - **You will not be able to recover your work.**
    - Make sure you have saved anything you need before you delete your environment.  

## Pause RStudio environment

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
cow::borrow_chapter(
  doc_path = "child/_child_rstudio_pause.Rmd",
  repo_name = "jhudsl/AnVIL_Template"
)
```

## Delete RStudio environment

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
cow::borrow_chapter(
  doc_path = "child/_child_rstudio_delete.Rmd",
  repo_name = "jhudsl/AnVIL_Template"
)
```
